======= Javascript development notes =======
Before importing the project on eclipse, be sure to run:
	mvn clean package

This will ensure the project has the right structure and all dependecies
already downloaded (including the Dojo Toolkit).

When developing the javascript code, you can use the following jasmine goal
to keep running your tests:
	mvn jasmine:bdd

It will start a server at http://localhost:8234/ and if you access it you
can run/rerun your javascript tests.

Also, by default the maven profile light-prod is active, so during maven build
your javascript will be compiled and minimized. For development, that may not
be such a good thing and you can deactivate this profile and activate
the light-dev profile by using the following -Dlight-dev=true flag. Example:
	mvn clean package -Dlight-dev=true

The light-dev profile basically copies the raw javascript files and a 
development loader (src/main/javascript/light/loader-dev.js) to the supposed 
built loader location. This development loader instead of trying to access
built code, it will try to load the raw javascript files.

That will allow you to use browser's debbuggers
and also it will allow you to configure eclipse to automatically output
stuff from src/main/javascript/light into target/light-*/js/light, so you don't
need to restart the webserver. 

I simple and productive workflow would be:
1) Build the project using the light-dev profile:
	mvn clean package -Dlight-dev=true

2) Configure eclipse to output src/main/javascript/light into
   target/light-*/js/light

3) Start the development server without rebuilding the project.
	mvn gae:start -Dgae.wait=true

4) Edit files from the client side in eclipse, reload the page affected
   and have fun!
